# Introduction

In this *blog* post, Iâ€™ll be walking you through the process of building my personal portfolio website using Next.js TailwindCSS, Velite and, of course, GitHub Copilot as my junior web developer. As a young data scientist and budding entrepreneur, I needed a clean, professional online space to showcase my projects, blog posts, articles (and lessons, coming soon ðŸ˜‰), all while leveraging modern web development tools. By combining the power of Next.js, TailwindCSS and Velite, Iâ€™ve created a simple and responsive portfolio that highlights my journey in data science, software design and creativity with a touch of personality. Letâ€™s dive into how I built this website.

# Why did I build a website?

Because I thought it would be fun (trust me, it wasnâ€™t). But seriously, why? 3 reasons:

1. Showcase my work to expand opportunities and boost credibility - Having a portfolio website gives me the perfect platform to present my projects and accomplishments in a way thatâ€™s detailed, interactive, and far more engaging than a simple resume or a short LinkedIn post. Itâ€™s like having a 24/7 showcase that potential employers, collaborators, or clients can explore, which opens the door to new opportunities and builds trust in my skills and expertise.
2. Build my personal brand and share my voice - I wanted a space where I could truly express who I amâ€”not just as a data scientist but as a thinker, writer, and innovator. Through my website, I can share my unique perspective, write about topics I care about, and craft a professional identity that resonates with others in my field. Itâ€™s about standing out and letting my voice be heard.
3. Share well-explained (tutorial) lessons - One thing Iâ€™ve noticed is the lack of well-explained, beginner-friendly tutorials in certain areas of data science, machine learning, mathematics and statistics. My website gives me a platform to fill that gap by sharing clear, practical lessons and insights that others can learn from. If I can make someoneâ€™s learning journey a little easier, thatâ€™s a win for me! (Spoiler: The learning page is a whole different project on its own, and is still in the pipeline).

# Stages of the project

I started this endeavour at the start of the winter break and had only 3 weeks to get it done. I had a part-time job to juggle so I needed tools to make my life easy and speed up the development process.

- Planning the project: The whole project was organized with Notion [Notion](https://www.notion.com/). Notion is an all-in-one workplace application that combines notes, documents, tasks, and project management into a single platform. It offers a versatile environment for personal (which is how I use it) and team productivity (offers a Pro plan for teams), allowing users to create and organize content.
- Getting Inspiration: I had an idea of what I wanted it to look like. For the longest time I had always wanted to build my portfolio website, I had a folder of bookmarks of all the websites I would like to copy. Websites that I got inspiration from include;
  - [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)
  - [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)
  - [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/)
  - [SLP](https://saaslandingpage.com/)
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates)
  - [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/)
- Designing the website: I designed the website for [Figma](https://www.figma.com). Figma Design is a great web application for all kinds of interface designs, from websites and mobile to desktop applications. It includes prototyping features and allows you to share and collaborate with clients and team members (design ). It has a user-friendly interface (I would be disappointed if it didnâ€™t). It also has a free tier, which offers unlimited personal drafts and a maximum of 3 collaborative design files. When designing the website, I came across
- Building the project: After designing my website, I had to pick the stack and tools, I would use to build it. I landed on Next.js, tailwindCSS and Velite. I choose Next.js and tailwindCSS because I have had prior experience with them and it would just make my life a little easier because I was on a timeline. I choose Velite because it would make it easy to post blog posts and articles with markdown.
- Deployment: I deployed the site on GitHub (more below).

# The Project Stack

- NextJS
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Velite

## Why Next.js

I went with Next.js as the backbone of my website. Next.js is a tool that helps developers build websites that are really fast, efficient and easy to find on Google. It makes sure that the pages people see are ready to go right away. Next.js is built on top of **React.js**. It takes Reactâ€™s capabilities for building user interfaces and adds additional features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing, which make it easier to build modern, high-performance web applications. It has many more benefits like image optimizations and code-splitting which you can look into further if you are interested [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

## Typing TypeScript

TypeScript is like an upgrade to JavaScript, which is a language that developers use to build websites and apps. JavaScript lets you write whatever you want, but TypeScript adds a checklist to make sure your instructions are correct and clear. With TypeScript, developers can catch mistakes earlier in the process, making their code more reliable and easier to understand. It helps prevent errors, especially as projects grow larger and more complex. TypeScript is an open-source, object-oriented programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft Corporation. [TypeScript website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Styling with TailwindCSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to build modern, responsive designs directly within your HTML (or JSX, in this case). Since the projectâ€™s pages are built as JSX components, Tailwind CSS became my go-to styling tool, acting as my trusty sidekick for crafting sleek and consistent designs effortlessly. Itâ€™s clean, efficient, and a huge time-saver. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). When digging through the documentation of the tailwind CSS, I came across one of their portfolio website showcases, which I fell in love with â€” guess what? I ended up copying as much as I could. This quote is my defence (my hands are up).

## Using Velite

To manage my content, I experimented with **Velite**, a lightweight framework designed for content-driven sites. Velite simplifies building type-safe data layers by converting Markdown, MDX, YAML, and JSON files into application-ready data. It allowed me to easily define collections (like articles and blogs) and handle them efficiently. That said, setting up the .velite folder required some troubleshooting. _Pro tip_: Read the docs carefully and double-check your paths in tsconfig.jsonâ€”itâ€™ll save you some headaches!

# Building The Pages of the Website

- **Homepage**: The homepage presents a clean, intuitive layout that welcomes visitors and provides easy access to key sections, creating a smooth user experience.
  - Newsletter Form: Brevo
- **About Page**: This section is structured to clearly highlight the professional background, key projects, and achievements, making it easy for visitors to learn about the creatorâ€™s journey.
- **Projects Page**: The projects are presented with dynamic cards, allowing for an interactive and organized display of each project.
- **Articles Page**: The articles section is seamlessly integrated with dynamic content, offering a smooth reading experience and easy content updates.
- **Spotify Page**:

These sections help make the website both functional and engaging, offering a comprehensive look at the work and journey behind it.

# Deployment

I deployed the project on GitHub Pages, primarily for the simpler .github.io domain name. Deploying a Next.js project to GitHub Pages involves automating the build and deployment process through GitHub Actions [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions). The process typically starts with setting up the build job, where dependencies are installed, and the Next.js app is built. The output is then prepared for deployment, and in the deployment step, the built files are pushed to GitHub Pages. Key configurations include specifying the correct Node.js version, caching dependencies for faster builds, and using actions like actions/deploy-pages for seamless deployment to GitHub Pages.

It is important to look into automation because it makes for consistency and saves time. Automating the build and deployment steps eliminates manual errors and increases reliability. GitHub provides common Actions (automations .yml) as a starting point. Most of the time, it should be enough for simple projects.

# Challenges Faced

![developer joke](./developer_joke.jpeg)

Not everything was smooth sailing, though.

Next.js 15 introduced changes to how params and searchParams are handled in synchronous and asynchronous components, causing some issues - [Upgrading to Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/version-15#asynchronous-page).

I ran into hiccups with dynamic imports, experimental module warnings, and typical dependency problems, requiring deep dives into Node.js warnings and cleaning up node_modules. Additionally, when deploying to GitHub Pages, itâ€™s important to remember that itâ€™s optimized for static sites, meaning dynamic components might not compile and if they do, they might not work as expected.

# Lessons Learned

1. **Efficiency is Key**: With limited time and a part-time job, the importance of choosing the right tools (Next.js, TailwindCSS, Velite) to streamline development became clear. The right stack can make or break your timeline.
2. **Flexibility of Markdown**: Veliteâ€™s ability to convert Markdown files into application-ready data (fancy way of saying, what you are reading now is markdown converted) made managing my blog posts and articles easier, but it required some patience. Double-checking paths and configurations in tsconfig.json is essential to avoid unnecessary roadblocks.
3. **Documentation is Your Best Friend**: Whenever facing issuesâ€”whether with dynamic imports or deployment to GitHub Pagesâ€”the docs were an invaluable resource. Investing time in reading documentation early saved me hours of troubleshooting later. Be sure to read the documentation to stay on top of updates on framework changes.
4. **Design Process Matters**: Taking time to plan and design my site in Figma, despite the limited time, allowing for a smooth development process. A well-organized design can guide you through the building process with greater ease.
5. **Deployment Automation**: Automating deployment through GitHub Actions significantly improved the consistency and reliability of my workflow. Setting up automated builds and deployments is a game-changer. Now, when I have a new blogpost, I simply push it and GitHub Actions handles the rest.

# Conclusion

Building this website was not just a technical challenge but a personal journey of growth. The project pushed me to enhance my development skills and was a good refresher (retired web dev, wink again) while allowing me to reflect on my career as a data scientist, new writer, and life-long learner. By combining Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Velite, I was able to create a visually appealing and functional portfolio thatâ€™s both easy to maintain and update. While there were moments of frustration (â€¦sighâ€¦), the experience taught me how to navigate web development workflows efficiently.

# What Next?

Now that my portfolio website is live, the next step is to focus on content. I plan to add more detailed projects, write blog posts on the latest developments in data science and machine learning, and launch a learning page with tutorials to help others in the field. Additionally, Iâ€™ll be refining the websiteâ€™s design and user experience as I continue to explore new web development tools and frameworks.

Stay tuned for updates and future projects!
