## The Stack

I went with Next.js as the backbone of my website. Why? It’s fast, SEO-friendly, and offers a great developer experience. The server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities were perfect for my goal of a high-performance site that loads faster than my coffee brews in the morning.

For styling, Tailwind CSS was my trusty sidekick. Forget writing CSS from scratch—Tailwind let me style my website directly in my JSX with utility classes. It’s clean, efficient, and a huge time-saver.

To manage my content, I experimented with Velite, a lightweight framework for content-driven sites. Velite allowed me to define collections (like blog posts) and handle them with ease, though it did take some debugging to get the .velite folder properly set up. Pro tip: read the docs and double-check your paths in tsconfig.json!

## Challenges

Not everything was smooth sailing, though. I ran into hiccups with dynamic imports, experimental module warnings, and the usual suspect: dependency issues. Fixing them involved some deep dives into Node.js warnings and meticulously cleaning up my node_modules.

## Features I’m Proud Of

1. Dark Mode: Who doesn’t love a good dark mode toggle? Tailwind CSS’s dark mode classes made implementing this super easy.
2. Dynamic Content: Blog posts are dynamically loaded using Velite, and the setup handles markdown files like a breeze.
3. Performance Optimization: Lazy-loaded images and SSR make the site lightning-fast.

## What’s Next?

The site is live, but a personal website is never truly “done.” I’m planning to add more animations, integrate an email subscription feature, and maybe even showcase some of my photography with a custom gallery component.

## Takeaways

Building this site taught me how to balance aesthetics and performance, troubleshoot tools I’d never used before, and experiment with new workflows. If you’re thinking of building your own, go for it—it’s the best way to learn and create something uniquely you.
