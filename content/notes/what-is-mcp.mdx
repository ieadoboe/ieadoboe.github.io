## What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol that allows AI assistants like Claude to interact with external tools, databases, and services in a standardized way.

### Key Features

- **Standardized Interface**: Provides a consistent way for AI models to access external resources
- **Tool Integration**: Enables AI assistants to use various tools seamlessly
- **Context Management**: Helps manage context across different data sources

### Why MCP Matters

In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, MCP represents a shift towards more modular and extensible AI systems. Instead of hardcoding specific integrations, MCP allows:

1. Dynamic tool discovery
2. Flexible resource access
3. Better separation of concerns

### Common Use Cases

- **Database Queries**: AI can directly query databases through MCP
- **File Operations**: Read and write files in a controlled manner
- **API Integration**: Connect to external APIs and services
- **Browser Automation**: Interact with web pages programmatically

### Example

When you ask an AI assistant to "read this file and summarize it," behind the scenes it might use MCP to:

1. Discover available file reading tools
2. Request the file contents through the protocol
3. Process the data and generate a response
