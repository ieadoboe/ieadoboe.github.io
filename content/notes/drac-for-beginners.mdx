## What is DRAC?

The **Digital Research Alliance of Canada (DRAC)** is Canada's national platform for advanced research computing, data management, and software solutions. It provides researchers with access to high-performance computing (HPC) resources, cloud computing, and research data storage.

### Why Use DRAC?

- **Free for Canadian researchers**: Access to world-class computing infrastructure at no cost
- **Scalable resources**: From small projects to massive simulations
- **Expert support**: Technical support and training resources
- **Secure storage**: Research data management with robust security

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an Account

Visit [alliancecan.ca](https://alliancecan.ca) and register using your institutional email.

### 2. Request a Resource Allocation

For most projects, you'll need to request:
- **Compute resources**: CPU/GPU hours
- **Storage**: Project storage space
- **Cloud resources**: If you need virtual machines

### 3. Connect to Systems

DRAC operates several national clusters:
- **Cedar**: General-purpose cluster
- **Graham**: Large-scale simulations
- **Beluga**: AI and machine learning workloads
- **Narval**: Québec-based cluster

## Basic SSH Connection

```bash
# Connect to Cedar cluster
ssh username@cedar.alliancecan.ca

# Connect to Graham
ssh username@graham.alliancecan.ca
```

## Running Your First Job

DRAC uses **Slurm** workload manager. Here's a simple job script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_first_job
#SBATCH --account=def-professor
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00
#SBATCH --mem=4G
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1

# Load modules
module load python/3.10

# Run your script
python my_script.py
```

Submit the job:

```bash
sbatch job_script.sh
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check job status
squeue -u $USER

# Cancel a job
scancel JOB_ID

# Check available modules
module avail

# Load a module
module load python/3.10

# Check account balance
sshare -U
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test locally first**: Debug on small datasets before scaling up
2. **Use modules**: Don't install software system-wide
3. **Request appropriate resources**: Don't over-request CPU/memory
4. **Clean up**: Delete temporary files to save storage quota
5. **Use scratch space**: For temporary computation files
